# 2015_suppression_consolidation
This repository was created to host data and scripts for Yunzhe Liu's project since 2013. 
Yunzhe analyzed fMRI data with concurrent skin conductance recording collected by Wanjun Lin in 2011. 
In this project, he aimed to investigate how overnight consolidation impacts on suppression of aversive memories.
